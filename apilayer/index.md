# API Implementation

This layer’s role within a Software Architecture, is to provide a set of capabilities to generate a layer of abstraction, decoupling, security, deployment and publication for Web APIs. 
Also, this layer delivers the elements to engage different parties with APIs providers, via an API Portal, Pages, Communities, etc.

Depending on the purpose degree of the API, OMESA divides the API layer into two sub-layers: 

![](/images/omesa_service_implementation_1.png)

1. **Single Purpose - API:** APIs’ capabilities in this category are those whose functional spectrum are targeted to cover a specific use case and potentially a single consumer. For example:  providing a subset of employee data for presentation in a mobile application. This scenario the functionality of the API would use business (multi purpose) APIs to gather the relevant data and then trim the information specifically for how that mobile application needs the data. In adopting this model we can address efficiency and user experience considerations. 
2. **Multi Purpose - API:** APIs’ capabilities in this category are those whose functional spectrum are targeted to cover different usages. The nature of these capabilities is to provide multiple usages, for example: consolidated views of key entities within the organization like Customer or product. Such an API can therefore be used across multiple systems, for example a Product API may support retail channels, supply chain or distribution processes, These kinds of APIs are more aligned with the goals of SOA.

## Core Capabilities

Within OMESA, Core Capabilities are meant to simplify design, as well as to justify and explain the presence of any layer in a software architecture. Once the desired capabilities have been identified, they can be usually realized by applying or extending one or more design patterns.

## Core Capability Definitions

* **AuthN/AuthZ** – authentication and authorization as mechanisms to control access, where authentication is the lighter check confirming a user is who they claim they are (username and password check against some for of identity management either via federation management or directly). Authorization considers the credentials further not only determining whether the credentials provided are valid, but also has the user been attributed with a suitable role for the operation required.
* **Traffic Management** - APIs are used by 3rd parties and that implies usage limiting for both the APIs and the applications that used them. A key capability to fulfill that is traffic management. With this APIs can apply policies to manage that.
* **API Key Validation** – when integrating applications as an alternative or supplement to AuthN/AuthZ is the use of an allocated key or token which is represented as typically a pseudorandom value in a string format. Prior to the application calling an API a developer will request through a developer portal a key for their application. During the API call the key is verified. This has the added advantage the API consumer can also revoke access to the API in addition to the provider. 
* **Origin Controls** – full authentication can be computationally expensive so the means to perform rapid preliminary filtering should be available. Such filters should include:
	* *Whitelisting* – ability to restrict access to approved sources. For example known partners (via their IP), where Cloud, multi-cloud or hybrid models are in use it should only possible to only allow known IPs reflecting the users cloud service IPs
	* *Blacklisting* – ability to prevent from origins that are deemed in appropriate for example sources of malicious activity to ensuring that internal API calls only originate from internal network locations.
	* *CORS* – when APIs are supporting front end services it maybe desirable to protect the APIs from cross origins misuse. CORS is covered in depth by the W3C - [https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
	Whilst not necessarily as light weight, the ability to screen in or out, or enrich APIs with attributing origin of the call geographically (geolocation) can be desirable, so that Services can be prevented from being used or allowing routing to an implementation of a service suited to that location. A common such use Case is managing of media streaming based on country agreements.
* **Tailored Contracts** – API contracts should be a perfect fit to what they represent. Contracts cannot be misleading, cannot contain less or more to what they are intended to be. Consumers are just aware about the contract, if the contact is not tailored for them, then the probability of not using it may increase. That is why the contract needs to be perfect fit to what they intend to be. An example around this are tailored contracts for different channels: mobile, web, etc.
* **Threat Protection** – Provides the elements to identify and protect the APIs from damage caused from the consumer usage or for non-consumers that want to compromise them. Protection mechanisms will include:
	* Injection attack protection – prevent API payloads from carrying content that when processed result malicious actions occurring, for example when several fields form a SQL expression when processed.
	* Buffer Overflow Errors – buffer overflows can be used to induce faults that can result in error messages being returned that provide insight into the systems being used, potentially allowing the attacker to use specific vulnerabilities to compromise the system.
* **API Monitoring and Analytics** - Focuses on usage statistics and health for an API. Not only for requests and responses, but to correlate the consumers with their APIs. Correlate applications with APIs. Deliver health status of the APIs. Identity abnormal activity and report it. It can be both historic data or real-time as we can see in the next capability.
Enable a real time analysis on the usage of the APIs. This capability will support to have in real time, information of the usage, engagement, errors, faults, threats of the APIs. 
* **Redaction and Masking** – APIs maybe carrying sensitive data the recording of API content to provide the monitoring capability also requires the ability to mask data values or even redact them. This capability is also of value to restrict payload content from transmission of data. For example if a standard data structure is being used across an insecure network then you may wish to redact that content, to be safe.
* **Consumer SDKs** – Allow the service consumers to have an SDK to use and engage with the APIs. This will give to the consumers all the elements to develop their own applications using the exposed APIs through this SDK. The SDK include: blueprints, samples and usage scenarios.
* **API Gateways** - Allows APIs to be deployed to the outside world. This is a piece of software that will allow the APIs to be deployed either they live on premise or in the cloud. This is a composed capability that use/offer other capabilities such as Threat Protection, Authentication, Authorization, Security etc.
* **API Portal & API Pages** – These capabilities are related to the exposure of the web channels to enable the engagement with third parties. This is in the form of a Web Portal where third parties can subscribe, search, register, read the documentation of the APIs
* **Community Management** - The development and publication of APIs will often involve multiple individuals (covering consumers and providers) with different access rights to different APIs. This therefore requires the means to manage such groups of communities.
* **API Discovery** – Enable the third parties to discover the APIs. This can be done through the API Portal. It is a very important capability that will allow the APIs to have the metadata, tags, documentation in order for third parties to discover them and interpret them in the right way. This is very relevant and is related with the level of abstraction that the APIs need to have 
* **HTTP Routing** – whilst a unified set of APIs needs to be offered and providing a single managed point of entry into an environment the implementation of APIs maybe spread across a wider network, therefore invocations of APIs need to routed into the correct part of the network for execution or even potentially further routing when networks have further subdivisions to isolate different data groups and classifications along with the differentiation of internal and external services.
* **API Resiliency** – APIs implementation needs to be fault tolerant. Consumers rely on the usage of the APIs, therefore the API should behave to fulfill the consumer expectations. Those expectations are high and include that the APIs should be available as much time as they can. 
Most of the APIs live in Cloud, therefore the elasticity capabilities are essential for the resiliency of the APIs. 
We refer to the API implementation to include fault tolerance, using some of the Service Layer characteristics, such as: Timeouts, Bulkheads, Circuit breakers, Redundancy. Applying those technics/characteristics will increase the fault tolerance of our APIs.
* **API Load Balancer** – an API Load Balancer is a specialized or enhanced gateway that has the means to not only control access and route traffic to the realization of an API but also has the means to apply load balancing algorithms when multiple instances an API realization exist. Typically, this requires the API Load balancer to contain a registry of implementations of an API. The registry is then used to record the arrival and disappearance of the implementations of APIs. In doing this we have the means to establish fault tolerant behavior and other factors needed when using scaling that is both elastic and dynamic in nature. [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/wilkins-api-mgmt-3796702.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/wilkins-api-mgmt-3796702.html). 
* **Traffic Management** – an API Gateway needs to manage the traffic, either is to limit the API calls for an specific consumer, or limiting the API calls during a window of time. Throttling the calls is also a key capability to enable transaction and traffic control of the APIs.  These capabilities allow us to protect backend solutions from being overloaded and/or ensuring that all clients of an API get a fair proportion of the API use.
* **Versioning and Audit** – it is important that the API layer can record who is making changes and when.this is important as a changes in the platform can have far reaching consequences. Investigation of s problem or consequences of a change will require the ability to see what has changed and when.. As the configuration of APIs need to be aligned with applications operating within the end to end environment it is necessary to understand an API in terms of versioning. The APIPlatform also needs to be able to support multiple versions of an API concurrently.
